# “One (Low Heel ) protesting that women were weak and silly Creatures… (High Head)  that they were strong, gallant, twice as hardy as any Man.” (August 50). 

This quote introduces two ladies named Low Heel and High Head and their viewpoints on women. Their names could have something to do with their ideas and could show that there are two different types of women during this time. A low heel is characteristic of something on the ground, signifying a sort of weakness.  In the past, inferior social classes usually had to get closer to the ground in order to show respect to the higher classes such as bowing.  This may represent Women who are meek and defenseless who “bow down” to their superiors which are men in this case.  Having a high head is usually sign of superiority; characterized by a straight back and having the nose to the air. The two are described as opposites that one often meets in this world of women. In the context of the book, High Head could be ambiguously representing the fact that women are free to make their own choices and that they are using this tide of homosexuality to have a sense of control in their own lives. High Head expresses that men are less intelligent than women and that their thoughts and ideas are very thin and plain, whereas women’s thoughts are more complex and imaginative. She describes women as the center of a spinning world and that they weave the threads of human destiny. From these claims we can determine that High Head is a figure for modern gender roles, much like Dame Musset. High Head is stating that women are strong and gallant, gallant meaning brave and heroic. This coincides with Musset’s belief that women can do for themselves without any other assistance. When she mentions that women are twice as hardy as any man, she means they are capable of enduring difficult conditions and hardships that men oppose on them.  
Low-Heel has the belief that during that time that women were weaker than men and could not physically compete with them in any way. Later in August, Low-Heel further states that women should “not declare herself in possession of her own Opinion, for an Opinion is a single and nice thing, for an Opinion is a single and a nice thing, not two Creatures sitting in Skull, sulking their away their Days.”  She thinks that women should not have their own opinions, because it could lead to disagreements and would not lead to any beneficial.  In fact, when she says “Creatures” I assume that it refers humans that continuously argue until they are “Skulls” eventually to the point that they was their entire life away.  Earlier in the text Tilly states that we need men for manual things such as carrying of coals and so on, and Low Heel would agree with this completely.  She believes that women are incapable of doing anything without the help of a man. When Low Heel is saying that women are weak and silly creatures she could be stating that women are just simple creatures, almost like animals to be groomed and owned by their masters, their husbands or men in general. 

Similar to Barnes’ stance, Wollstonecraft (an English advocate for women’s rights) also perceived that women at that time felt feeble in comparison to men. This ties into our belief that women could not survive without assistance during this time. However, she believed that change should be made in terms of women’s rights and even supported a revolution in order to make this a reality.  There may have been a “Revolution” not physically, but through the text of Ladies Almanack by women standing up for what they want and who they want to be with.  They perhaps wanted equal footing with men; free from chains and the fear of being judged for their behavior that was not considered womanly during this time period. Likewise since there were vast inequalities from legal to social rights of men and women it is possible that women were using homosexuality to show their dominance over their own bodies. An example from the source states, “women at the present are by ignorance rendered foolish or vicious” (Wollstonecraft, 192). We can ascertain that Wollstonecraft is trying to convey to the reader that women are considered foolish if they are ignorant in the amount of control that they really have. Since it was commonplace to view women as objects or things to be controlled, this was a revolutionary claim.

# Classical Lesbianism

## Internal Evidence

Prevalently shown in the chapter of January as well as scattered throughout the text, lesbianism during this time period was a taboo. One example of this is in May when Patience says, “...what can you women see in each other? Where is the Parting of the Ways and the Horseman that hunts?”. This was a common reaction to this female-female relationship. (Barnes 31)  First, we must analyze the speaker of this quote in order to place it into context.  Since the speaker is Patience Scalpel, we know from the text that she is a fervent traditionalist as shown by her confusion by the two women who were gamboling in January. We can also assume that Patience Scalpel is only shown throughout the text to explain what the traditionalist viewpoint would say, and contrast it to the viewpoints of the pro-lesbian Dame Musset.  However, this is also applicable to the public opinion of lesbianism that was maybe perceived at the time. We believe that when Patience is referring to the parting of ways and the horseman, Barnes was trying to convey that there is a split occurring from the traditional views of heterosexual relationships to the new more modern views that others have, such as characters like Dame Musset.

Our second example of this is in March when Patience says, “...sinning in a double and similar Sin; rising unprovided for by Church or Certificate…” (Barnes 19). We interpreted this to be Barnes conveying that the popular belief at the time was that lesbianism was very sinful and and would result in terror being acted out upon those who participated in the act. The mention of the certificate is alluding to the fact that this was not a legal practice during this time, and that people were mostly against the notion that homosexual individuals could be together. The rising unprovided for is likely a allusion to the growth of homosexual rights, because during this time they were pretty much nonexistent.

In this source it states that the study of homosexuality began in 1869. While this is before the time that Ladies Almanack was written, it can be seen that not much information had been gathered about the subject. Since we know that Barnes was born in 1892, she was growing up during the early stages of these studies. It likely had an impact on her writing and led to the creation of the Ladies Almanack. Early generations of sexologists were several individuals who themselves identified as homosexuals and directed their scholarly activity toward both the elimination of prejudice and discrimination and the demand for equal human rights. This is something to consider since they themselves were the one who were gathering the data. A period between roughly 1900 and 1930 was one of considerable intellectual activity in the areas of sexology and literature concerning lesbianism. Since we know that the text was published in 1928 it probably stirred up a lot of controversy concerning the roles of men and women.

Throughout this project we have noticed some central themes. The first of these themes is an apparent internal conflict. There are internal conflicts within the characters, one example of this could be the internal struggle that Musset has when her relationship with Doll ends. At first she is very sad and sinks into a deep dark depression but at the same time she seems to get over it and moves on. Another example could be an internal conflict within Barnes herself. She has the two opposing characters that are supporting two very different ideas. Patience, who has a more classical view towards women and their roles as wives and individuals. This is the antithesis of Musset, who has a more modern view. Barnes could be struggling with her role as a woman and with these new controversial perspectives that she grew up with. 
Another theme is that the old is fighting the new. Some characters represent this like Tweed-In-Blood and Buck-and-Balk, Musset and Scalpel, and High Head and Low Heel. For every individual that believes one way there is an opposing individual to argue with about the topic. These figures also embody the views of religion at the time. Some believe in a traditional marriage and others do not. This is why we tied our video in, so that others may see what an issue this topic still is today.

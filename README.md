# Ladies Almanack First Project

### By: Hardwynn Tunacao and Taylor Rose


On this site we will be discussing Djuna Barnes in her work titled Ladies Almanack. This text was published in France 1928, a time when lesbianism and gender roles/norms were being tested at every turn. Throughout this site we will elaborate on these two aspects further. We will be comparing the old viewpoints with the new, and by doing so, we hope to widen our understanding of the text and how it applies to history today.
